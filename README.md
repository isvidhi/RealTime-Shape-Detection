# RealTime-Shape-Detection
A C++ project using OpenCV to detect and classify geometric shapes (triangles, squares, rectangles, circles, and polygons) in real-time from webcam video. The program applies edge detection, contour approximation, and shape recognition, then overlays labels on the live video feed.
